                    NIST Speech Disc CD1-1.1
                          October 1990


This CD-ROM contains the complete TIMIT acoustic-phonetic speech corpus.  
TIMIT was designed to provide speech data for the acquisition of acoustic-
phonetic knowledge and for the development and evaluation of automatic 
speech recognition systems.  The disc was prepared at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) with sponsorship from the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency - Information Science and Technology Office 
(DARPA-ISTO).

The following files and subdirectories are located in the top-level directory
of this CD-ROM:

       convert/ - directory containing ESPRIT SAM software for converting 
                  TIMIT speech files into a SAM compatible format;  This
                  software (version 1.2) has been slightly modified from the 
                  version distributed on the Resource Management CD-ROMs 
                  (version 1.1) to work with TIMIT.
                                  
    /readme.doc - this file

        sphere/ - directory containing a new version (1.5) of the NIST SPeech 
                  HEader REsources (SPHERE) software;  SPHERE is a set of
                  "C" library routines and programs for manipulating the NIST
                  header structure prepended to the TIMIT waveform files.

         timit/ - directory containing the TIMIT corpus as well as TIMIT-
                  related documentation.  
                                    
Each of these directories contains a "readme.doc" file which may be consulted
for more detailed information.
